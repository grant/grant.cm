        | Four engineers are riding in a car when it stalls. The mechanical engineer suggests a timing problem. The electrical engineer says it's a bad spark. The chemical engineer offers that it was caused by a poor fuel mixture. The computer engineer has no idea but says, "If we get out of the car and get back in again, it may start."
